# asynp [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/narma/asynp.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/narma/asynp)

A Clojure core.async wrapper around the excellent [NuProcess library by Brett Wooldridge](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/NuProcess/) for efficiently interacting with a potentially large number of subprocesses concurrently.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

[![Current Version](https://clojars.org/asynp/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/asynp)

## Usage

The following is a roughly complete demonstration of features and usage:

```clojure
(require '[asynp.core :refer [run-process wait-for-process shutdown-process
                              close-stdin-for-process  write-str-to-process
                              log-strings decode-chars]])
(let [process-dict (run-process ["/bin/cat"])]

  ;; set up readers for stderr and stdout
  (log-strings (decode-chars (:out process-dict)) \u0000)
  (log-strings (decode-chars (:err process-dict)) \newline)

  ;; write content
  (write-str-to-process process-dict "Hello world\u0000Partial write")
  (Thread/sleep 1000)
  (write-str-to-process process-dict "...completed\u0000")

  ;; close stdin
  (close-stdin-for-process process-dict)

  ;; wait for 5 seconds for the process to exit, then force a shutdown
  (println (str "Exit status: " (wait-for-process process-dict 5000)))
  (shutdown-process process-dict))
```
